#### Book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors

A book recommendation system is a type of recommendation system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on his interest. 

Book-Crossings dataset, which contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users, was used and a model was developed with `NearestNeighbors` from `sklearn.neighbors` to build a book recommendation system.
